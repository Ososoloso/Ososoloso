- 👋 Hello, I’m @Ososoloso
- 👀 I’m interested in ML, Tensorflow, full-stack web development & Data Science. 
- I am looking to master Data Analytics and Data base design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, and SQL. 
- 💞️ I actually speak three languages: spanish, english and german, and I would like to collaborate in any project that would allow gain even a microscopic insight on UX design, relational databases, and  in whichever of these communities. I currently have some very basic experience with python & java, but decided to give web design a chance since it incorporates much of what I think I would be best at. Designing a good UX and designing scalable databases.
